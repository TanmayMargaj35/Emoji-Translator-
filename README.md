# 🧠 Emoji Translator

A simple and fun project that converts words in a sentence into emojis.  
It uses a custom JavaScript dictionary to map specific words (like **love**, **pizza**, **coffee**) into their corresponding emojis.

## 📌 Project Description
Emoji Translator is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that takes user input, splits it into words, checks for matching words in an emoji dictionary, and then replaces them with emojis.  
This is a great project to practice **string manipulation**, **array methods** (`split`, `map`, `join`), and basic **DOM manipulation** in JavaScript.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Input** – User types a sentence into the input box.
2. **Processing** –  
   - The program splits the sentence into words using `split(" ")`.
   - Each word is converted to lowercase for matching.
   - If a word exists in the `emojiDict`, it is replaced with its emoji.
   - Otherwise, the word stays the same.
3. **Output** – The translated sentence (with emojis) is displayed on the screen.
